            "content": "Limitations Inherited to ML . A model cannot be created without data. Models outputs are predictions, not actions. The data can be divided into . a training set, | a validation set, and | (optionally) a test set. | @startuml Bob -&gt; Alice @enduml . A training set roughly consists of 70 % of the data and is used to train the model. A validation set—used to validate the models performance—of 20 % is accomplished by a test set of 10 %. . . Model goals We want a model to predict previously unseen data by finding general patterns in the data it is trained with, called generalization. The thing is called memorization—memorize all data it was shown and so fail at previously unseen data. One sign our model tries to memorize instead of finding general patterns in our data is by overfitting. . Pretrained Model . A pretrained model is a model which weights already have been trained by experts for a specific task, e.g. image recognition with ImageNet dataset. . With transfer learning, a pretrained model is used to accomplish a different task. TODO: give example With a pretrained model, the learning process requires much less performance and time, because weights only have to be adjusted, not learned by the model from scratch. . . Warning: Image classification . Imagine what you can turn into images: audio signals, movements, or time series. This can be used to let models for image classification for different tasks. For example, a model trained for mouse movement images can be used for malware detection. . Model accuracy can be increased by segmentation—recognize every pixel of an image . Dataset tipps . Without good data, a model cannot achieve good results (garbage in, garbage out principle). Use cut-down versions of datasets—subsets of the dataset—for prototyping and experimenting. . Hyperparameters are parameters about parameters. . Training set trains the model. The model sees this data. Validation set validates performance (improves) the model. We see the data. Test set evaluates the model at the very end of our efforts. Neither the model nor we see this data until the very end. .",

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
